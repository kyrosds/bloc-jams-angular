## Bloc Jams Angular

This project is a reconfiguration of the original [Bloc Jams] (https://github.com/kyrosds/bloc-jams) which was completed with Jquery. All of the pages have been updated with an Angular frame work and work as intended. This is a music player that stores albums in the collection page and plays the music on the album page, the user is able to toggle between albums from either the album page or the collection page.
